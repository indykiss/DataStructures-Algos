My plan for the next 4-5 weeks is to study Cracking
the coding interview. 

It's a classic and one I haven't done tons with. 
I read the chapters but didn't do all the problems, 
so I'm starting from scratch at chapter 1. 

I'm using this repo to track my progress. 

Ideally, I can finish ~4 chapters a week. Then have 1
week totally off. If I can't finish ~4 chapters, then 
I have an extra week to work on it. Plus still take a 
couple of days off. 
I'm building in an automatic Sunday off rest day. :) 
Hopefully that'll prevent burnout.
