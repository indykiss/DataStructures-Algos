/*
Trees and graphs aren't linear, so harder to traverse. 
Worst and average time can vary really wildly too. 

Binary Tree = tree with every branch having 2 or fewer leaves/ children brances 
Binary Search Tree = Binary tree where the left node is smaller than the parent 
node and the right child is larger than the parent node. 

Balanced vs unbalanced trees:

A BST is balanced when the left and right subtrees' heights differ by 1 level at the most. AND the left subtree is balanced AND the right subtree is balanced. 
    - Note: A tree can be height or weight balanced. One does not affect the other.

A full and complete tree is when all the leaves in a tree are at the bottom of
the tree and all non-leaf nodes have exactly two children. 

Traversing a tree:

In-order:
Post-order: 
Pre-order: 

Breadth-first search is a way to explore a tree or graph by looking 
at the nodes one step away, then two steps away. 

Depth-first search is a way to explore a tree or graph by traveling down
one node branch to the end, then turning around if couldn't find the thing, 
then traveling down another branch, etc, until we find the find we want.
