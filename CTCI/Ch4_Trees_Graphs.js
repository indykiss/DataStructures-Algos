Trees and graphs aren't linear, so harder to traverse. 
Worst and average time can vary really wildly too. 

Binary Tree = tree with every branch having 2 or fewer leaves/ children brances 
Binary Search Tree = Binary tree where the left node is smaller than the parent 
node and the right child is larger than the parent node. 

Balanced vs unbalanced trees:

A BST is balanced when the left and right subtrees' heights differ by 1 level at the most. AND the left subtree is balanced AND the right subtree is balanced. 
    - Note: A tree can be height or weight balanced. One does not affect the other.

A full and complete tree is when all the leaves in a tree are at the bottom of
the tree and all non-leaf nodes have exactly two children.
