Systems design for a smart electric meter system for an apartment building with one dashboard for tenants to show hourly/weekly/monthly/yearly readings to their specific units, and another dashboard for the owner with similar readings but only by floors or building electricity usageâ€¦ Started with big components, and was allowed to delve into specifics in any other area per interviewee comfort and expertise. 

Create a design where you have electric meters at unit and they send the information to central service. Your web-app should display the information for the customers and admin to see thier usage utility.

# Product requirements
- Dashboard for tenant
  - Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly readings? Historical data past 5 years.  
    - Are we dividing utility usage by electric, water, gas or just 1 dashboard for all? Each. 
    - Are we potentially using the data to provide tips to tenants on how to save money? Sure, extended feature. 
  - UI/ UX is important. Data visualization clear for gen popul.
- Dashboard for landlord 
  - Summarize information for all tenants 
    - Multiple buildings? Each building has its own? 
- User login for both tenants and landlords 
- Connection to the hardware that monitors the utilies 
  - Existing architecture to connect to as we add this smart meter 
- Room by room usage 
- Let's say it writes once a day
  - Other option could be a continuous delivery 

# Start with building UI based on product requirements
- Draw out the tenants dashboard:
  - 6 graphs total. 3 for change over time in usage. 3 for change in cost over time 
- Draw out the landlord dashboard:
  - Drop down for building 
    - Within each building:
      - 6 graphs. 3 for change over time usage and 3 in change over time cost.  

# API Endpoints. Communication between components 
# Write -- reading -- updating -- deleting

  # Apt hardware is pulling data from apts into a table
  - /write_water_metric, params: dateTime, water_data, aptID  
  - /write_gas_metric, params: dateTime, gas_data, aptID 
  - /write_elec_metric, params: dateTime, elec_data, aptID

  # Uses data to build tenant dashboards 
  - /dashboard_ten_get_water, params: startDate, endDate, water_data, aptID
  - /dashboard_ten_get_gas, params: startDate, endDate, gas_data, aptID
  - /dashboard_ten_get_elec, params: startDate, endDate, elec_data, aptID 

  # Uses data to build landlord dashboards 
  - /dashboard_ll_get_water, params: startDate, endDate, water_data, buildingID
  - /dashboard_ll_get_gas, params: startDate, endDate, gas_data, buildingID
  - /dashboard_ll_get_elec, params: startDate, endDate, elec_data, buildingID

  # Calculate data to make dashboards 
  - /calc_apt_cost_over_time, params: startDate, endDate, type_of_util, cost_of_util, aptID
  - /calc_apt_usage_over_time, params: startDate, endDate, type_of_util, aptID 
  - /calc_build_cost_over_time, params: startDate, endDate, type_of_util, cost_of_util, buildingID
  - /calc_build_usage_over_time, params: startDate, endDate, type_of_util, buildingID  

  # Build visualization: Dashboard converts the data to charts

  # Build accounts
  - /create_account, params: email, pw (secure), name, unit, userType
  - /login, params: email, pw, userType  

  # Dropdown for building
  - /get_building_by_landlard, params: buildingID, landlordID

# Scale 
Small scale, 


# Data schema: SQL because relational 
Tenant user table: userID, aptID, buildingID, email, pw
Landlord user table: userID, email, pw 
Building table: buildingID, ownedByLandlordID

Water metric table: aptID, buildingID, dateTime (by day), usage_field, cost_of_water 
Gas metric table: aptID, buildingID, dateTime (by day), usage_field, cost_of_gas
Electric metric table: aptID, buildingID, dateTime (by day), usage_field, cost_of_electric 
  - These three data tables can be very big; if doing daily
  - Can these all fits into one DB or do we need to vertical (1 server getting larger)/ horiztonal scaling (multiple servers)? 


# High level architecture, UI/ UX
- Web app (React maybe) -> backend server -> database 
- Load balancing, caching
- 

# Data flow, there are two ways: 
Request/ response HTTP data flow 
  HTTP = get, post, put
Publish/ subscribe data flow
