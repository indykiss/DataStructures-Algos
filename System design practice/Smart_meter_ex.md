Systems design for a smart electric meter system for an apartment building with one dashboard for tenants to show hourly/weekly/monthly/yearly readings to their specific units, and another dashboard for the owner with similar readings but only by floors or building electricity usageâ€¦ Started with big components, and was allowed to delve into specifics in any other area per interviewee comfort and expertise. 

Create a design where you have electric meters at unit and they send the information to central service. Your web-app should display the information for the customers and admin to see thier usage utility.
