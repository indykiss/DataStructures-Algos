/*
Queue Position swapping 

People are waiting in line. Each have a sticker with their original position. 
People can swap places with the person directly in front of them, up to two times but no more. 
Find the minimum number of swaps needed to get back to the original order of 1 -> n. 

So the correct order: [n = i + 1 for ALL values]. Find the difference between what the actual value is and what we're seeing BUT only 1 way, we don't want to double count. Increment count. 

If diff is > 2, then "too chaotic."
