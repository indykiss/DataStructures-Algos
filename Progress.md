# November: What did I accomplish?
- In ~3 weeks, 80 algos total. 
- F technical call, passed! 
- Bl onsite, failed :( Reapply in May 
- See below methodology for counting algos.


# October: What did I accomplish?
In ~2 weeks, I did 70 algos total. Reviewed lots of Grokking problems: 30 refreshes. 40 brand new ones. 


## Methodology for counting algos: 
Found 70 by guesstimating/ counting commits from mid-Oct to end of Oct. 1 commit = 1 problem. Found 40 uniq by comparing this repo at end of Oct with mid-Oct. See search tracker spreadsheet to check out list of uniq algos (just copied and pasted all the .js files from directory). Did ~120 code commits in Oct, more heavy in 2nd half of Oct.
