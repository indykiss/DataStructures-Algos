# April plan:
- 1 week: Finish up system design:
    - Watch youtubes of Instagram + top 5 system design 
    - Sys design extra credit: Commenting, Typeahead suggestion, privacy settings, proximity server, top N songs
    - 2 practice interviews with system design 
- 1-2 weeks: LEETCODES! Heavy 
    - 2 practice interviews with coding 


# March : Do 1 system per day at least 
- Going through Grokking the system design interview 
    - Web crawler, Search, Newsfeed, Messenger, Youtube/ Netflix, Twitter
    - Done: TinyURL, Instagram, Basics 
- Light leetcoding to stay sharp 
- Grokking object oriented design as quick pre-course for system design 
    - Library, parking lot, ATM, Amazon, Facebook 

# February:
- From Dec - March, only +30 new algos, but that's ok. Dec-Feb was tough 
- Work with Dom to work through practicing algos 
- Couple interviews (5 with 1 company, 2 with another + 1 in March)


# January:
- Should have done:
    * Algoexperts / LC side by side
    * 1/2 of Pton DS&A course but skip through Java implementations, just do the psets/ notes in JS or Python 

- But between packing & storing all my stuff and temporaily moving across country, I didn't accomplish this. 
- Took January off 


# December: What did I accomplish?
- Interview Cake review 
- CS50 quick run through


# November: What did I accomplish?
- In ~3 weeks, 80 algos total. 
- F technical call, passed! 
- Bl onsite, failed :( Reapply in May 
- See below methodology.


# October: What did I accomplish?
In ~2 weeks, I did 70 algos total. Reviewed lots of Grokking problems: 30 refreshes. 40 brand new ones. 


## Methodology for counting algos: 
Found 70 by guesstimating/ counting commits from mid-Oct to end of Oct. 1 commit = 1 problem. Found 40 uniq by comparing this repo at end of Oct with mid-Oct. See search tracker spreadsheet to check out list of uniq algos (just copied and pasted all the .js files from directory). Did ~120 code commits in Oct, more heavy in 2nd half of Oct.

* Onsite #2 pushed to June. But probably bad, might need to 
reschedule back to being sooner depending on onsite #1

// To be deleted : 
Day of April onsite, if it goes well, email recruiter immediately. 
Drafted bc I will be all over the place mentally: 
"Hi! Sorry to be all over the place with scheduling. After our last 
connect, a recruiter at X co/ a FAANG reached out to start the process. 
Their timeline was really fast, so just had their onsite today. 
I think it went well, but haven't heard back yet. I know timelines can be tricky. 
I love your mission of "X" and loved chatting w/ your engineers; you're my 1st pick. 
Super sorry to ask- but would it be possible to move onsite scheduled
in June to be sooner? Maybe next week or the week after if possible?
If not possible, pls let me know the soonest we can schedule.
Thanks for your time XO"

If not, no worries, keep studying.
