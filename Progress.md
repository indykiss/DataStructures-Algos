* Onsite on April 1st 

+ 2 technical phone screens Feb/March.ish

# ----------------------------------------------#



# February To-dos:
- The 'coding interview university' thing?
- Leetcode? Algoexpert? IDK. Just make progress 
- Work with Dom to work through practicing algos 


# January:
- Should have done:
    * Algoexperts / LC side by side
    * 1/2 of Pton DS&A course but skip through Java implementations, just do the psets/ notes in JS or Python 

- But between packing & storing all my stuff and temporaily moving across country, I didn't accomplish this. 
- Took January off 


# December: What did I accomplish?
- Interview Cake review 
- CS50 quick run through


# November: What did I accomplish?
- In ~3 weeks, 80 algos total. 
- F technical call, passed! 
- Bl onsite, failed :( Reapply in May 
- See below methodology.


# October: What did I accomplish?
In ~2 weeks, I did 70 algos total. Reviewed lots of Grokking problems: 30 refreshes. 40 brand new ones. 


## Methodology: 
Found 70 by guesstimating/ counting commits from mid-Oct to end of Oct. 1 commit = 1 problem. Found 40 uniq by comparing this repo at end of Oct with mid-Oct. See search tracker spreadsheet to check out list of uniq algos (just copied and pasted all the .js files from directory). Did ~120 code commits in Oct, more heavy in 2nd half of Oct.
