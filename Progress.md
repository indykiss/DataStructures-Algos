# July 
- Coding interview course maybe ?
"Checklist.md"
- Plan new project
    - Fullstack app definitely
    - Hosted on Heroku for ease
- Begin project
- Build testing suite, baby CI/CD
- Can use RoR if I want
    - Or can do python w/ bootstrap?
    
Possible project options:
    - Dev a sharepoint/ onedrive site
    - Dev a case capture form
        - Admin portal w/ case builder email, 
        template for email, client name, when to email
        - Automatically send email to that email w/ template
        on that date
        - User gets link to the form to fill out
        - With option to fill out form OR change end date
        of project on their end 
        - After form completed, gets sent to me & Laura
    - Upgrade datapond by a lot

- Maybe learn Python, do new project in Python 
- Or use RoR w/ Python data viz
- Did a little game devs. Small but fun

- Narrowing project plan down on paper

- Continuing to learn about project management

# May: 
What actually happened: 
- MK 1st round HR, 2nd round Hackerrank, 3rd round pair
- Studied SQL, QA, React, API queries
- QA 1st round- failed, but learned about QA so not total loss
- PM studying (3 /7 hrs done), TEI/ PEI prep
- LC lightly

Leetcodes practiced last week:  ~10 + ~10 SQLs

Original plan: 
- Coding : HEAVY on the mediums, warm up with easies
- Watch youtubes of system design 
    - Web crawler, Search, Commenting, privacy settings, proximity server, top N songs
    - 2 practice interviews with system design 
- Implement trie : done! But practice 
- have been doing fair amount of SWE job apps, research (youtubes), to 
create pipeline


# April plan:
- Onsite! Rejected, but that's ok, was a long shot
- Coding : HEAVY on the mediums, warm up with easies
- System design 
- Vacay/ recover from failure for 2 weeks 


# March : 
- Going through Grokking the system design interview 
    - Web crawler, Search
    - Done: Typeahead, Newsfeed, Messenger, TinyURL, Instagram, Basics, 
    Youtube/ Netflix
- 2 system design interviews w/ interviewing.io
- Light leetcoding to stay sharp 
- Grokking object oriented design as quick pre-course for system design 
    - Library, parking lot, ATM, Amazon, Facebook 


# February:
- From Dec - March, only +30 new algos, but that's ok. Dec-Feb was tough 
- Work with Dom to work through practicing algos 
- Couple interviews (5 with 1 company, 2 with another + 1 in March)


# January:
- Should have done:
    * Algoexperts / LC side by side
    * 1/2 of Pton DS&A course but skip through Java implementations, just do the psets/ notes in JS or Python 

- But between packing & storing all my stuff and temporaily moving across country, I didn't accomplish this. 
- Took January off 


# December: What did I accomplish?
- Interview Cake review 
- CS50 quick run through


# November: What did I accomplish?
- In ~3 weeks, 80 algos total. 
- F technical call, passed! 
- Bl onsite, failed :( Reapply in May 
- See below methodology for counting algos.


# October: What did I accomplish?
In ~2 weeks, I did 70 algos total. Reviewed lots of Grokking problems: 30 refreshes. 40 brand new ones. 


## Methodology for counting algos: 
Found 70 by guesstimating/ counting commits from mid-Oct to end of Oct. 1 commit = 1 problem. Found 40 uniq by comparing this repo at end of Oct with mid-Oct. See search tracker spreadsheet to check out list of uniq algos (just copied and pasted all the .js files from directory). Did ~120 code commits in Oct, more heavy in 2nd half of Oct.
