Two fun string questions. Both basically leetcode easys. 
My approach for both was maybe unconventional. 

In the second problem, I needed to adjust my while loop from && to ||
and somehow that really stumped me? I don't know. I really need
to build a more solid foundation. Like literally do ALL the easys
and don't look at the answer/ discussion section. 

I felt like I could possibly go next round or not. Who knows honestly. 

It's ok, time to study for FB now anyways. 

If I get bloomb onsite, awesome, if I don't, no biggie. FB in Nov. Then google
whenever I'm ready. 


Nov ???: Onsite 

There were two interviews. Both interviews started off with ~30 mins of trivia type questions:
- Define array, linked list, hash table. Academic definitions needed 
- What is time complexity for x, y, z above
- Why use linked list over array 
- REALLY drilled in exercises for arrays with set size
Dynammic arrays, which I've never worked with, so new concept 
- Both interviews heavy into space saving for some reason 
- Binary search, define sorts verbally 
- ASCII, define it and how we use it 
- Garbage collection? 
- Neither asked actual leetcodes for the second half of interviews (~20 mins)
One asked to create a stack using a linked list and a magic node(???). Learn that.
Other asked for creative way to store company-revenue pairing data only using 
one array of size 10. Maybe answer was touple, but idk what a touple is really 

- Practice answering "about me" questions that deviate from the actual question. "So you do research, what kind of research?" It's fine to immediately do my normal 'about me' answer and not just answer that one question very directly. But summarize with answer the question
