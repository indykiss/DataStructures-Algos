Two fun string questions. Both basically leetcode easys. 
My approach for both was maybe unconventional. 

In the second problem, I needed to adjust my while loop from && to ||
and somehow that really stumped me? I don't know. I really need
to build a more solid foundation. Like literally do ALL the easys
and don't look at the answer/ discussion section. 

I felt like I could possibly go next round or not. Who knows honestly. 

It's ok, time to study for FB now anyways. 

If I get bloomb onsite, awesome, if I don't, no biggie. FB in Nov. Then google
whenever I'm ready. 


Pattern:
A search in a sorted collection, think binary search. Minimum # of steps, think BFS. Min/max K elements, think heap. Optimization, think DP.
