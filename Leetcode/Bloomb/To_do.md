Two fun string questions. Both basically leetcode easys. 
My approach for both was maybe unconventional. 

In the second problem, I needed to adjust my while loop from && to ||
and somehow that really stumped me? I don't know. I really need
to build a more solid foundation. Like literally do ALL the easys
and don't look at the answer/ discussion section. 

I felt like I could possibly go next round or not. Who knows honestly. 

It's ok, time to study for FB now anyways. 

If I get bloomb onsite, awesome, if I don't, no biggie. FB in Nov. Then google
whenever I'm ready. 


Pattern summaries:
A search in a sorted collection, think binary search. Minimum # of steps, think BFS. Min/max K elements, think heap. Optimization, think DP.

# Sliding window: 
We have an array or a linked list that we need to 
find something within a specific range in the arr. 

Exs: 
- Find the longest substr of repeating chars in a str. 
- Fruits in a basket. We have 2 baskets and an arr of num. What's the most fruit we can have (longest subarr of 2 ints). 
- Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1. Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

# Multiple pointers / Two pointers
When we have a sorted arr or linked list and we want to find 
a set of eles that meet a certain requirement. 

Ex:
- Two sum. We have an arr and a target. Find the 2 nums that equal target. 
- We have 2 sorted arrs. We want to merge them
