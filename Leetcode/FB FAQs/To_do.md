# November
## I have time for 60- 80 algos for BOTH bloomberg & facebook. Do 20- 30 new meds/ hards. Refresh ~40+. 



# ----------------------------------------------#

*Last day! I did the top 5 in the phone screen list*
*Do only the next 2-3 on that list + Task Scheduler*
*Copy list with random pointer, BT right side view, task scheduler*
*Quickly review my "why FB + about me" and look at patterns*

* ~5x a week, do 4-6 problems from Search Tracker *
* Move the finished problems to Done column *
* Call a problem done if I can do it within 30 mins mostly without more than 1-2 hints *
# ----------------------------------------------#



# To-dos: 
## Leetcodes: 60 
- Top 15 Bloomberg mediums, 10 hards. 
- Top 10 FB mediums, 5 hards.
- Warm up with FB/ Bloomb easies. (20.ish)
    - Every day do 1-2 easies. 



# October: What did I accomplish?

## In ~2 weeks, I did 70 algos total. Reviewed lots of Grokking problems: 30 refreshes. 40 brand new ones. 

## Methodology: Found 70 by guesstimating/ counting commits from mid-Oct to end of Oct. 1 commit = 1 problem. Found 40 uniq by comparing this repo at end of Oct with mid-Oct. See search tracker spreadsheet to check out list of uniq algos (just copied and pasted all the .js files from directory). Did ~120 code commits in Oct, more heavy in 2nd half of Oct.
