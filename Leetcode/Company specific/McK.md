# 3 coding questions in 2 hrs on HckRnk

- 2 backend questions, which ended up being 1 leetcode easy and 1 lc med 
Not going into specifics, but once I understood the questions, they weren't too 
hard to program out. 
BUT spent maybe ~20 mins too long for these 2, because the last Q was
difficult. Took me 1 hr to do these 2

- 1 frontend question, as in building a list of stuff and displaying
the stuff with a few other requirements. I got zero of the tests/ requirements
because I got really stuck on my onclick() not working. 
I should've spent some time building out pseudo code at the bare minumum
but I didn't. I ran out of time. 
The code I did write was pretty bad too. 
4 requirements total. Honestly, was probably a VERY simple thing to do
but I could only use vanilla JS and it's been a long time since
I've built frontends using vanilla and not react. 
I only studied react. I should've also studied basic JS frontend 
(.addEventListener, document.getElementById, etc)

Sad face. 

Maybe I can apply again next year
