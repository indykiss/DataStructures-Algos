Node depths 

The distance between a node in a BT and the tree's root is called
its depth.

Write a function that takes in a binary tree and returns the 
sum of its nodes depths. 

Each binary tree node has an integer value, a left child node, and 
a right child node. Children nodes can either be binary tree nodes
themselves or none/null.
