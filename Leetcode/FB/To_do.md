# October


### To-dos: 

## Grokking: Two weeks of 4 hour days = Complete all of it. 
## I don't need to complete all of it. Just like half! 

## Strat for Grokking:
## Have Grok on left of screen. Look up LC. Do LC on right of screen. 
## Double win. Doing grokking + doing a leetcode! 
## Great momentum. Keep going!! 1.5 weeks of this and I'll be done! 
## Leave the last 2-3 challenges alone so I can go back and review them in Nov. 

## Sun: Cyclic sort! 4-5 algos total only.  

- Begin grokking patterns 
- ONLY do the easys and a couple mediums 


## Leetcodes
- 5.ish FB mediums
- 2-3 more FB easys 

## FB Coding Exercises
- 28 total on the FB site  

### Finished:
- First 10 easys. Should do a few more easys
- Done 5/ 10 mediums. 



# November





# Sliding window: 
We have an array or a linked list that we need to 
find something within a specific range in the arr. 

Exs: 
- Find the longest substr of repeating chars in a str. 
- Fruits in a basket. We have 2 baskets and an arr of num. What's the most fruit we can have (longest subarr of 2 ints). 
- Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1. Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 


# Multiple pointers / Two pointers
When we have a sorted arr or linked list and we want to find 
a set of eles that meet a certain requirement. 

Ex:
- Two sum. We have an arr and a target. Find the 2 nums that equal target. 
- We have 2 sorted arrs. We want to merge them 


# Fast and Slow Pointers 
Two pointer strategy that move through an arr at different
speeds. Esp useful in a cyclic linkedlist. 

Basically one goes slow and another goes fast and 
where they meet is the answer. 

Ex: 
- Finding the cycle in a linked list 


# Merge Intervals 

We're looking to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals
if they do overlap. Intervals being an arr of arrs with starting point
and end point. 

Ex:
- Find number of meeting rooms needed.
- Merge intervals. 


# Cyclic sort
Describes an approach to deal with problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range. 

Ex: 
- Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array
