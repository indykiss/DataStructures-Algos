# October


### To-dos: 

## Grokking: Two weeks of 4 hour days = Complete all of it. 
## I don't need to complete all of it. Just like half! 

## Strat for Grokking:
## Have Grok on left of screen. Look up LC. Do LC on right of screen. 
## Double win. Doing grokking + doing a leetcode! 
## Leave the last 2-3 challenges so I can go back and review them in Nov. 

# Grokk:
## After binary search, we just have 5 sections left. We'll be 2/3rd done! 
## Those 5 are also weird/ fringe things so maybe run thru by Sun. 


## Friday! Modified Binary Search. Do like 4-6 of these
## Bitwise XOR if we can. It's just 3! Just do 3! 



# November

## Leetcodes
- 5.ish FB mediums
- 2-3 more FB easys 

## FB Coding Exercises
- 28 total on the FB site  

### Finished:
- First 10 easys. Should do a few more easys
- Done 5/ 10 mediums. 
- Mostly will be done with Grok by Nov



# Grokking patterns summary: 

# Sliding window: 
We have an array or a linked list that we need to 
find something within a specific range in the arr. 

Exs: 
- Find the longest substr of repeating chars in a str. 
- Fruits in a basket. We have 2 baskets and an arr of num. What's the most fruit we can have (longest subarr of 2 ints). 
- Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1. Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 


# Multiple pointers / Two pointers
When we have a sorted arr or linked list and we want to find 
a set of eles that meet a certain requirement. 

Ex:
- Two sum. We have an arr and a target. Find the 2 nums that equal target. 
- We have 2 sorted arrs. We want to merge them 


# Fast and Slow Pointers 
Two pointer strategy that move through an arr at different
speeds. Esp useful in a cyclic linkedlist. 

Basically one goes slow and another goes fast and 
where they meet is the answer. 

Ex: 
- Finding the cycle in a linked list 


# Merge Intervals 

We're looking to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals
if they do overlap. Intervals being an arr of arrs with starting point
and end point. 

Ex:
- Find number of meeting rooms needed.
- Merge intervals. 


# Cyclic sort
Describes an approach to deal with problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range.

Key terms: "We are given an unsorted arr with numbers ranging from 
1 to N" or anything close. 

Ex: 
- Cyclic sort 
- Find all missing numbers in an unsorted arr that has 1 to N nums


# Reverse a linked list 
When we need to reverse a linked list, particularly in place, 
or any variation of reversing a linked list. 

- Literally ONLY need to learn like 
reverse a linked list. AND reverse linked list from 
points A to B. 


# Tree: BFS (queue, levels)

When we need to traverse a tree in a level by
level order, use breadth first search. We use a queue to keep  track of all the nodes of a level before we move to the next level. Space always O(N) where n is the number of nodes. 

- Binary tree level-order traversal 
- Return an arr of arrs with all the values on each level
of a binary tree
- Return the avg of each level in a BT 


# Tree: DFS (stack, paths)
We use recursion, OR A STACK using iterative, to track all the previous (parent) nodes while traversing. This makes our space always O(H) where H is the height of the tree.  

- Binary Tree Path Sum 
- Find the root-leaf path that equals given sequence, or 
equals target sum 


# Two Heaps
When we need to divide eles into a small heap and a 
larger heap of things. Min heap / max heap. 

Not wasting my time with two heaps right now. If I get 
min/max heap, I'm screwed. Maybe look at this later when studying for google. 


# Subsets 
When we need to deal with permutations or combinations of a set of elements. 
Grokking goes over a breadth first way to handle these Qs. 

- Find all possible subsets in an arr of eles
- Generate parenthese


# Modified Binary Search 
When we have a sorted array, Linked List, or Matrix, we can do a binary search 
through it.
