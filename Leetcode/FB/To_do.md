### To-dos: 

## Grokking: Two weeks of 4 hour days = Complete all of it. 
## I don't need to complete all of it. Just like half! 

## Strat for Grokking:
## Have Grok on left of screen. Look up LC. Do LC on right of screen. 
## Double win. Doing grokking + doing a leetcode! 
## Great momentum. Keep going!! 1.5 weeks of this and I'll be done! 
## Leave the last 2-3 challenges alone so I can go back and review them in Nov.
