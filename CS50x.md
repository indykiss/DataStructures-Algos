# Week 1 notes: 
Go back and look at transcript for exact summary but:

- Compiler goal is to make input code run through algo 
to convert to binary so computer can give us output 

- when we run code, we compile it first and make the program 
using "ruby." This goes into the file, imports anything that 
needs to be imported, runs the algos, creates the output. 
Compiles our source code (code we write) into machine code (code the computer understands).
    ruby nameFile.rb 

- In C, a "long" is a very long number. Int is integer which 
goes to like some billion. Long goes longer than int. 

- Overflow: the point at which the integer or float that we're looking at has surpassed the number of bits we have (8, 16, 32 bits, etc) in storage. We try to add one, but because we're at capacity, we lose the data. 
Y2K problem was because of integer overflow. Programmars stored only 2 digits for years (70s/ 80s/ 90s), not 3 digits,so the number 2000 broke systems.
