// Need to quickly make a couple tests for these, just to practice. Super simple ones

// In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.
// Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

// Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
// Output: true
// Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.

var isAlienSorted = function(words, order) {
    // Words are the words we're looking at
    // Order is the alien alphabet
    
    let newArr = [...words]
    // Let's sort this replicated arr; best practice is to not alter original arr
        .sort((a, b) => {
    // We compare each first letter of the words in arr to see if they are      alphabetical
            for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        // If there's a tie, we continue
                if (a[i] === b[i]) continue;
            // If the words aren't alphabetical we do maths to say its false
            // and vice versa. Goal is boolean so we do this:
                if (order.indexOf(a[i]) > order.indexOf(b[i])) return 1;
                if (order.indexOf(a[i]) < order.indexOf(b[i])) return -1;
            }
            return a.length - b.length;
        }).join('') === words.join('');
    
    // Returns boolean
    return newArr;
};
