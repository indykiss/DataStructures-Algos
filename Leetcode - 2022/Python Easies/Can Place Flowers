Can Place Flowers
You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.
 
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false

#o(N) time and constant space

class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:

        for i in range(len(flowerbed)):
            empty_left = (i == 0) or (flowerbed[i-1] == 0)
            empty_right = (i == len(flowerbed)-1) or (flowerbed[i+1] == 0)
            curr = flowerbed[i]

            if empty_left and empty_right and curr == 0:
                n -= 1
                flowerbed[i] = 1

            if n == 0:
                return True      

        return n <= 0   # < bc might have many spots for flowers [0,0,0,0,1] 1
