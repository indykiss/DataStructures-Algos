# Software Development Lifecycle 
Goal: to make high quality software in the lowest
amount of time & money. 
Ensures all stakeholders have a chance to
give input in early stages. 
Shortens development timelines by preventing
after-the-fact fixes. 
Gives everyone on the cross-functional team an understanding of the costs/ resources needed. 
Ensures problems don't get compounded since each phase needs to be accomplished in order. 

Some drawbacks include: 
- can reduce communication between departments as it's a linear model. QA and UX might not be involved during the implementation which can create knowledge silos. 
- process heavy, not tons of flexibility
- creates a single poit of failure in the early stages. 
    - Agile is very people over process, but with SDLC it's hard to make quick adjustments 
- creates a single points of failure in the early stages
BUT SDLC gets incorporates into the agile dev methodology, using sprints to work through phases. 

In an ex of using a sprint to work through SDLC, the team will review backlog. ID a few strategic projects. Assign tasks. Focus on those tasks through the end of the sprint. Then next sprint. 


Diff models include: Agile model, waterfall model,
and spiral model. 

- Gather requirements 
- Planning 
- Software design
