# Data structures and algos and big O, oh my! 
As a bootcamp graduate with a good amount of practical software engineering under my belt, I've realized that my knowledge of data structures and algorithms are a bit lacking. Not having a traditional computer science background will do that to ya. 

So I'm going to review concepts and think about how to solve problems. 

I'm using this repo to help keep track of the things I've learned and what I want to learn next. 

It's a little unorganized at the moment, as I'm using a few resources vaguely structured by week, to learn core topics.

Will organize this soon!
