# Data structures and algos and big O, oh my! 
As a bootcamp graduate with some amount of practical software engineering under my belt, I've realized that my knowledge of data structures and algorithms are a bit lacking, by not having a traditional computer science background.

So I'm going to review concepts and think about how to solve problems. 

I'm using this repo to help keep track of the things I've learned and what I want to learn next. 

It's a little unorganized at the moment, as I'm using a few resources vaguely structured by week, to learn core topics.



## Resources I've covered:
- InterviewCake 
- Leetcode
- Hackerrank 
- Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions 
- Interviewing.io for practicing talking about code 
- Cracking the Coding Interview (need to complete)
- Company specific study sheets (parallels hackerrank/ leetcodes)
- Udemy's The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algos + Data structures by Stephen Grider
