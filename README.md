# Data structures, algos and distributed system design
As a bootcamp graduate with practical software engineering experience, I've realized that my knowledge of data structures and algorithms have been a bit lacking. So I'm studying traditional CS concepts to bridge those gaps.

I'm using this repo to help keep track of the things I've learned and what I want to learn next. 


## What am I studying now? 
Highly recommended coding interview university:
