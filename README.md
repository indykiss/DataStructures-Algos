# Data structures, algos and distributed system design
As a bootcamp graduate with practical software engineering experience, I've realized that my knowledge of data structures and algorithms have been a bit lacking. So I'm studying traditional CS concepts to bridge those gaps.

I'm using this repo to help keep track of the things I've learned and what I want to learn next. 


## What am I studying now? 
- Working on a new project, KPI Builder, and learning Python
- Refreshing algorithmic thinking and data structures problem solving 


## Resources I've covered, in no particular order:
- InterviewCake 
- Leetcode
- Hackerrank 
- Harvard's online CS50x course 2020
- Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions 
- Interviewing.io for practice talking about code 
- Company specific study sheets (parallels hackerrank/ leetcodes)
- Udemy's The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algos + Data structures by Stephen Grider
- https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer
- Technical case studies : Solving digital problems
